; Parameters:
;   addresstype (string):   'absolute' or 'pointer'.
;   compressed (bool):      true or false

;   paletteAddress (hex):   Address of palette data
;   numPalettes (hex):      Number of palettes

;   size (hex):             Size of the data (if uncompressed)

;  For addresstype "absolute":
;   address (hex):          Address of the data
;  For addresstype "pointer":
;   ptrAddress[i] (hex):       Address of the pointer(s)
;   bankAddress[i] (hex):      Address of the bank number(s)
;   bank (hex):             The bank number (if bankAddress is unspecified)

; Notes:
; - Palette stuff isn't implemented yet.
; - 'pointer' is only useful if data is compressed. Use 'absolute' otherwise, or edit the ROM directly.
