; Text is compressed with RLE (Run-length encryption).

; It's not standard ascii; textTable.txt tells what
; values correspond to what letters.

; Also, these values aren't the addresses of the 
; text. They're the addresses of the pointers to
; the text, so if the new text is bigger than the
; old text, it can be moved.
; If only one number is provided, it's assumed to
; be the address of the actual text.

; The first number is the address of the pointer,
; the second is the address of the bank number.

; Note that equals signs and tabs both act as separators.
; their functions are basically the same.
